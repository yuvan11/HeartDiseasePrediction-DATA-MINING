# HEART DISEASES PREDICTION USING DATA MINING TECHNIQUES
Mar 2020 â€“ Apr 2020

**Project description**

We carried out an experiment to find the predictive performance of different classifiers. We select four popular classifiers considering their qualitative performance for this experiment. We used a heart disease data set available at kaggle machine learning repository.In order to compare the classification performance of four machine learning algorithms, classifiers are applied on the same data and results are compared on the basis of misclassification and correct classification rate and according to experimental results.

**Result**

Out of many classifier algorithms, **Decision Table** gave the best in performance.
